In the `components` directory, you will see 4 different basic implementations of [ghbtns.com](ghbtns.com) as a web component. Each approach has benefits and drawbacks, and they are provided as a starting point for understanding how these different methods of building web components may work for you or your project.

The four implementations are:

* AngularJS - A pseudo web component using the AngularJS application framework from Google
